# marsviewer
A React webapp using NASA's Mars Photos API to display Mars rovers pictures

This project uses one of [NASA's public API](https://github.com/corincerami/mars-photo-api) to retrieve corresponding photos from SOLs (Martian days) and cameras of the selected rover.
It is currently hosted on [my own website](https://marsviewer.stacked.work).

Feel free to submit any issues or pull requests. I'm open to any suggestions.
